- `MONITORING_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## üéÆ Usage Instructions

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start all services
node scripts/service-manager.js start-all

# Start monitoring dashboard
node scripts/monitoring-dashboard.js

# Start background monitoring
node scripts/health-monitor.js start &
node scripts/error-monitor.js start &
```

### Service Management
```bash
# Check service status
node scripts/service-manager.js status

# Start individual services
node scripts/service-manager.js start frontend
node scripts/service-manager.js start backend

# View service logs
node scripts/service-manager.js logs frontend 50
```
