# **Zoho CRM Python SDK v2 (Unabridged)**

## **1\. Overview**

The Python SDK provides a way to create client Python applications that integrate with Zoho CRM. It acts as a wrapper for the Zoho CRM REST APIs, simplifying the process of accessing and using CRM services. The SDK handles authentication via OAuth 2.0 and manages HTTP requests and responses.

**Key capabilities:**

* Exchange data between Zoho CRM and a client application using class-based models for CRM entities.  
* Access CRM API equivalents as simple member methods.  
* Push data into Zoho CRM by accessing the appropriate APIs.

## **2\. Environmental Setup**

Your client application environment must meet the following requirements:

* **Python Version:** 2.7 or higher.  
* **Dependencies:** requests library must be installed.  
* **Installation:** The SDK must be installed via pip.  
* **Initialization:** The ZCRMRestClient.initialize() method must be called at application startup.

**Note on Tokens:** Access and refresh tokens are environment-specific (Production, Sandbox) and domain-specific (US, EU, CN, etc.). Using tokens from a different environment or domain will result in an error.

## **3\. Installation of SDK**

Install the SDK using pip.

**Install SDK and Dependencies:**

\# Install the SDK  
pip install zcrmsdk

\# Install the requests library (if not already present)  
pip install requests

The SDK will be installed as a package named zcrmsdk in your Python's site-packages directory.

Upgrade the SDK:  
To upgrade to the latest version, run:  
pip install \--upgrade zcrmsdk

## **4\. Register Your Application**

All Zoho CRM APIs are authenticated with OAuth2, so you must register your application to get API credentials.

**Registration Steps:**

1. Go to the Zoho API Console: https://api-console.zoho.com  
2. Click **Add Client ID**.  
3. Enter the **Client Name**, **Client Domain**, and **Authorized Redirect URI**.  
4. Select the **Client Type** as **Web based**.  
5. Click **Create**.  
6. Your Client ID and Client Secret will be available. Click **Options â†’ Edit** on your newly created app to view them.

You will receive the following credentials:

* **Client ID:** The consumer key.  
* **Client Secret:** The consumer secret.  
* **Redirect URI:** The callback URL you registered.

## **5\. Import the SDK**

Import the SDK into your Python project.

**Standard Import:**

import zcrmsdk

**Import with an Alias:**

import zcrmsdk as your\_custom\_name

## **6\. Configuration**

The SDK must be initialized by passing a configuration dictionary to ZCRMRestClient.initialize(config). As of version 2.0.0, .properties files are no longer supported.

### **Configuration Dictionary Keys**

The dictionary must contain key-value pairs for configuration. The required keys depend on the persistence method.

| Persistence Type | Mandatory Keys | Optional Keys |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **File Persistence** | client\_id, client\_secret, redirect\_uri, token\_persistence\_path | applicationLogFilePath, sandbox, access\_type, accounts\_url, apiBaseUrl, apiVersion, currentUserEmail |
| **MySQL Persistence** | client\_id, client\_secret, redirect\_uri, mysql\_username, mysql\_password, mysql\_port | (Same as above) |
| **Custom DB** | client\_id, client\_secret, redirect\_uri, persistence\_handler\_class, persistence\_handler\_path | (Same as above) |

### **Key Descriptions**

* **client\_id, client\_secret, redirect\_uri**: Your OAuth client credentials.  
* **access\_type**: Must be set to offline.  
* **token\_persistence\_path**: Path to store OAuth tokens in a file. If not set, database persistence is used.  
* **applicationLogFilePath**: Absolute path for SDK exception logs.  
* **sandbox**: Set to true to use the sandbox environment. Default is false.  
* **accounts\_url**: Domain-specific accounts URL (e.g., https://accounts.zoho.com). **Do not include a trailing slash.**  
* **apiBaseUrl**: Domain-specific API URL (e.g., https://www.zohoapis.com). Mandatory for non-US domains. **Do not include a trailing slash.**  
* **apiVersion**: The API version. Should be v2.  
* **currentUserEmail**: The email ID of the user whose credentials are used. **Required**.

**Example Configuration (File Persistence):**

config \= {  
    "client\_id": "1000.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",  
    "client\_secret": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",  
    "redirect\_uri": "\[https://www.your-app.com/callback\](https://www.your-app.com/callback)",  
    "token\_persistence\_path": "/path/to/your/token/storage",  
    "currentUserEmail": "user@example.com",  
    "accounts\_url": "\[https://accounts.zoho.com\](https://accounts.zoho.com)",  
    "apiBaseUrl": "\[https://www.zohoapis.com\](https://www.zohoapis.com)",  
    "sandbox": "false",  
    "access\_type": "offline"  
}

### **Database Persistence**

* **SQL Database:** If you use MySQL for token persistence, install the connector: pip install mysql-connector.  
* **Custom Database:** For custom DB persistence, you must implement the AbstractZohoOAuthPersistence class and its methods (get\_oauthtokens, save\_oauthtokens, delete\_oauthtokens). You must also provide the persistence\_handler\_class and persistence\_handler\_path in your configuration.

## **7\. Initialization**

Your application must be initialized to generate and handle OAuth tokens.

### **Generating Grant and Refresh Tokens**

* **For a Single User (Self-Client):**  
  1. Go to the Zoho Developer Console (https://accounts.zoho.com/developerconsole).  
  2. Select **Self Client** for your application.  
  3. Enter the required scopes (including aaaserver.profile.READ).  
  4. Generate the grant token.  
  5. Use this grant token to generate an initial refresh\_token by making a POST request to https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token.  
* **For Multiple Users:**  
  1. Your application's UI must provide a "Login with Zoho" option that redirects users to the Zoho grant token URL.  
  2. After a user successfully logs in, the grant token is sent as a parameter to your registered redirect\_uri.

### **Generating Access Tokens**

The SDK handles token generation and persistence after the initial setup.

**First-time generation (from Grant Token):**

\# Initialize with your config dictionary  
ZCRMRestClient.initialize(config)

oauth\_client \= ZohoOAuth.get\_client\_instance()  
grant\_token \= "paste\_your\_grant\_token\_here"  
oauth\_tokens \= oauth\_client.generate\_access\_token(grant\_token)

**First-time generation (from Refresh Token):**

\# Initialize with your config dictionary  
ZCRMRestClient.initialize(config)

oauth\_client \= ZohoOAuth.get\_client\_instance()  
refresh\_token \= "paste\_your\_refresh\_token\_here"  
user\_identifier \= "user@example.com"  
oauth\_tokens \= oauth\_client.generate\_access\_token\_from\_refresh\_token(refresh\_token, user\_identifier)

Once tokens are persisted, the SDK automatically manages refreshing the access token.

## **8\. Class Hierarchy and Responses**

### **Class Hierarchy**

The SDK models Zoho CRM entities as classes. ZCRMRestClient is the base class. The hierarchy mirrors the CRM's entity structure (e.g., ZCRMModule contains methods to access ZCRMRecord objects).

* To get an actual entity with data populated via an API call, use get\_...() methods (e.g., ZCRMRestClient.get\_module("Contacts")).  
* To get a dummy instance without making an API call (useful for invoking non-static methods), use get\_instance() or get\_module\_instance() (e.g., ZCRMModule.get\_instance("Contacts")).

### **Accessing Record Properties**

Common fields like createdTime are direct members of a ZCRMRecord object. All other module-specific fields are stored in a map.

* **Get a field value:** record.get\_field\_value("Field\_API\_Name")  
* **Set a field value:** record.set\_field\_value("Field\_API\_Name", new\_value)

### **Responses and Exceptions**

* API methods return wrapper objects: APIResponse, BulkAPIResponse, or FileAPIResponse.  
* The actual entity or list of entities is available in the .data attribute of the response object.  
* All SDK and API errors are thrown as a single ZCRMException. You should wrap your API calls in a try...except ZCRMException block.

## **10\. Common Errors and Solutions**

#### **No OAuth and Configuration Properties**

* **Symptom:** Terminal shows json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value.  
* **Reason:** The user has not set the necessary configuration properties or the OAuth properties in the configuration dictionary.  
* **Solution:** Ensure all mandatory keys (client\_id, client\_secret, redirect\_uri, etc.) are correctly set in the configuration dictionary passed to ZCRMRestClient.initialize().

#### **Invalid Code**

* **Symptom:** Error message contains invalid\_code.  
* **Reason:** The grant token (authorization code) has expired.  
* **Solution:** Regenerate the grant token and use it within the stipulated time.

#### **KeyError: 'Email'**

* **Symptom:** A KeyError: 'Email' is raised during token generation.  
* **Reason:** The scope Aaaserver.profile.READ was not included when generating the grant token.  
* **Solution:** Include Aaaserver.profile.READ along with other Zoho CRM scopes when generating the grant token from the developer console.

#### **Exception occurred while fetching OAuthtoken from DB**

* **Symptom:** Log shows No rows found for the given user.  
* **Reason:** The email ID specified in currentUserEmail does not have a corresponding OAuth token in the persistence layer (database or file). This happens when you initialize the SDK for a user who has not gone through the OAuth flow.  
* **Solution:** Generate an access token for that specific user first by running the one-time token generation script.

#### **currentUserEmail value is missing**

* **Symptom:** ZohoOAuthException: currentUserEmail value is missing.  
* **Reason:** The mandatory currentUserEmail key is missing from the configuration dictionary.  
* **Solution:** Add the currentUserEmail key and the corresponding user's email to the configuration dictionary.

#### **Invalid Client**

* **Symptom:** Response contains 'error': 'invalid\_client'.  
* **Reason:** The grant token was generated from a different domain than the one being used to request the access token. For example, generating a grant token on accounts.zoho.com but trying to get an access token from accounts.zoho.eu.  
* **Solution:** Ensure both the grant token and access token are generated from the same domain. The accounts\_url in your config must match the domain where you registered the client.

#### **Invalid OAuth Token**

* **Symptom:** API call fails with a 401 error and invalid\_oauth\_token.  
* **Reason:** The access token was generated for one domain (e.g., US) but is being used to make an API call to a different domain (e.g., EU).  
* **Solution:** Ensure the apiBaseUrl in your configuration dictionary corresponds to the domain for which the tokens were generated.

#### **The Object is not JSON Serializable**

* **Symptom:** TypeError: \<zcrmsdk.Response.APIResponse object ...\> is not JSON serializable.  
* **Reason:** An entire APIResponse object is being passed as a value to another API call (e.g., setting the 'Owner' field with the response from get\_user). You must pass the data payload, not the whole response wrapper.  
* **Solution:** Use the .data attribute of the response object to extract the entity data. For example, use resp.data instead of just resp.

#### **URL Path Issue (Double Slash)**

* **Symptom:** ZCRMException Caused by:'Unknown ZCRMException' or ZohoOAuthException ... 404\.  
* **Reason:** The apiBaseUrl or accounts\_url in the configuration dictionary has a trailing slash (/). The SDK adds the slash automatically, resulting in a double slash (//) in the final URL.  
* **Solution:** Remove the trailing slash from the apiBaseUrl and accounts\_url values in your configuration dictionary.

#### **Incorrect apiVersion**

* **Symptom:** Unknown ZCRMException or JSON decoding errors.  
* **Reason:** The apiVersion key in the configuration is set with a capital 'V' (e.g., "V2"). It is case-sensitive.  
* **Solution:** Ensure the value for the apiVersion key is in lowercase: "v2".
