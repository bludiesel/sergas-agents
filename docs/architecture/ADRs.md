## ADR-001: Adopt AG-UI Protocol for Streaming

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Decision Made**: Replace simple HTTP proxy with AG-UI protocol for streaming communication between CopilotKit frontend and GLM-4.6 backend.

### Context
The current system uses a basic HTTP proxy pattern where requests are forwarded synchronously to GLM-4.6 backend with no real-time capabilities. Users wait for complete responses before any UI updates occur.

### Decision
We will implement AG-UI (Agent-User Interaction) protocol as the communication layer between CopilotKit UI components and our GLM-4.6 agent system.

### Rationale
**Benefits of AG-UI Protocol**:
1. **Standardized Communication**: AG-UI is an open standard developed by CopilotKit, LangGraph, and CrewAI
2. **Real-time Streaming**: Enables immediate response streaming vs. waiting for complete responses
3. **Built-in Event Types**: 16 standardized event types for lifecycle, messages, tools, and state
4. **Tool Visualization**: Automatic tool call visualization in CopilotKit UI components
5. **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any agent backend (our GLM-4.6 agents)
6. **Production Ready**: Battle-tested by major agent frameworks

**Performance Improvements**:
- **Response Time**: 2-4x faster first response (streaming vs. wait-for-complete)
- **User Experience**: Immediate visual feedback and progress indication
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduced memory usage through streaming instead of buffering

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Custom WebSocket Implementation**: More flexible but requires 2-4 weeks of development
2. **GraphQL Subscriptions**: Complex implementation, over-engineering for our needs
3. **Enhanced HTTP Polling**: Inefficient, higher latency, poor UX

**Conclusion**: AG-UI protocol provides the best balance of standardization, performance, and implementation speed.

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- 60-80% reduction in frontend development time
- Immediate response streaming for better UX
- Automatic tool call visualization
- Standardized error handling patterns
- Future-proof with open protocol standard

**Negative**:
- Additional dependency (`ag-ui-protocol` Python package)
- Learning curve for AG-UI event patterns
- One more layer in the architecture

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Gradual migration with feature flags
- Team training on AG-UI patterns

## ADR-002: Event-Driven State Management Architecture

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Decision Made**: Implement centralized, event-driven state management for real-time agent coordination across all frontend components.

### Context
Current implementation uses component-level state management with `useCopilotAction` hooks. State is fragmented across components with no global synchronization, making real-time coordination between multiple agents difficult.

### Decision
We will implement a centralized state management system based on event-driven architecture using React Context and useReducer patterns.

### Rationale
**Benefits of Event-Driven State**:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All state changes flow through centralized reducers
2. **Real-time Synchronization**: Automatic state updates across all components
3. **Predictable State Flow**: All changes go through defined action types
4. **Time Travel Debugging**: Easy to track state changes and debug issues
5. **Consistency**: No state synchronization issues between components

**State Management Architecture**:
```typescript
// Centralized state structure
interface GlobalAgentState {
  activeWorkflows: Record<string, WorkflowState>;
  agentStatuses: Record<string, AgentStatus>;
  connectionStatus: ConnectionStatus;
  systemMetrics: PerformanceMetrics;
}

// Event-driven updates
type AgentAction =
  | { type: 'WORKFLOW_STARTED'; payload: WorkflowState }
  | { type: 'AGENT_STATUS_CHANGED'; payload: AgentStatus }
  | { type: 'CONNECTION_CHANGED'; payload: ConnectionStatus }
  | { type: 'ERROR_OCCURRED'; payload: Error }
```

**Performance Benefits**:
- **Reduced Re-renders**: Precise state updates minimize unnecessary re-renders
- **Memory Efficiency**: Shared state reduces memory footprint
- **Developer Experience**: Easier debugging and state inspection

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Zustand Store**: Lightweight but less structured than our custom solution
2. **Redux Toolkit**: Overkill for our state management needs
3. **React Query**: Focused on server state, not client-side coordination

**Conclusion**: Custom event-driven state management provides optimal balance of control, performance, and maintainability for our specific agent coordination needs.

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Consistent state across all components
- Automatic real-time synchronization
- Simplified debugging and testing
- Better performance through optimized re-renders

**Negative**:
- Initial complexity increase
- Learning curve for event patterns
- More boilerplate code

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- Detailed examples and patterns
- Developer documentation and training

## ADR-003: Hybrid Communication (SSE → WebSocket Evolution)

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Decision Made**: Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) initially with planned evolution to WebSocket for bidirectional communication.

### Context
Real-time communication is required for streaming responses and agent coordination. We need to choose between SSE (unidirectional) and WebSocket (bidirectional) for our initial implementation.

### Decision
We will implement Server-Sent Events as the primary streaming mechanism, with architectural support for future WebSocket upgrade when bidirectional communication becomes necessary.

### Rationale
**Why Start with SSE**:
1. **Simplicity**: SSE is simpler to implement and debug
2. **AG-UI Protocol Native**: AG-UI was designed for SSE transport
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Universal support without polyfills
4. **Reliability**: Automatic reconnection built into EventSource API
5. **Development Speed**: 1-2 weeks implementation vs. 3-4 weeks for WebSocket

**SSE Implementation Architecture**:
```python
# Backend - FastAPI StreamingResponse
@app.post("/api/copilotkit")
async def copilotkit_endpoint(input_data: RunAgentInput):
    async def event_generator():
        encoder = AGUIEventEncoder()

        # Stream AG-UI events
        async for event in orchestrator.execute_streaming(...):
            yield f"data: {encoder.encode(event)}\n\n"

    return StreamingResponse(event_generator(), media_type="text/event-stream")
```

```typescript
// Frontend - AG-UI Client
const agent = new HttpAgent({
  url: '/api/copilotkit',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

**WebSocket Evolution Path**:
1. **Phase 1**: Implement robust SSE streaming
2. **Phase 2**: Add WebSocket support for bidirectional features
3. **Phase 3**: Hybrid mode (SSE for streaming, WebSocket for control)

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **WebSocket Only**: More complex upfront, bidirectional features not immediately needed
2. **HTTP Long Polling**: Inefficient, higher latency, poor UX
3. **Custom Streaming Protocol**: Non-standard, maintenance burden

**Conclusion**: SSE-first approach provides fastest path to production while maintaining architectural flexibility for WebSocket evolution.

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Faster time to market (1-2 weeks vs. 3-4 weeks)
- Simpler implementation and debugging
- AG-UI protocol compatibility out-of-the-box
- Reliable automatic reconnection

**Negative**:
- Unidirectional communication (server → client only)
- Cannot receive real-time user input during execution
- Limited compared to WebSocket capabilities

**Mitigation**:
- Design AG-UI client with WebSocket upgrade path
- Implement user action queuing for later WebSocket phase
- Keep backend architecture WebSocket-ready

## ADR-004: Multi-Agent Orchestrator Pattern

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Decision Made**: Implement a centralized orchestrator pattern for coordinating multiple GLM-4.6 agents with real-time status tracking and inter-agent communication.

### Context
Current system has individual agents (memory analyst, data scout, recommendation author) but no central coordination. Complex workflows require manual sequencing and lack real-time visibility into multi-agent execution progress.

### Decision
We will implement a centralized Agent Orchestrator that manages workflow execution, agent lifecycle, and inter-agent communication through event-driven architecture.

### Rationale
**Orchestrator Benefits**:
1. **Workflow Coordination**: Automatic sequencing and dependency management
2. **Real-time Visibility**: Live status of all agents and workflow progress
3. **Resource Management**: Optimized agent pooling and load balancing
4. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry and fallback mechanisms
5. **Inter-agent Communication**: Structured messaging between agents

**Orchestrator Architecture**:
```python
class AgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_registry = {}
        self.workflow_queue = asyncio.Queue()
        self.active_workflows = {}

    async def execute_workflow(self, workflow_config):
        """Execute multi-agent workflow with real-time coordination."""
        # Discover and orchestrate agents
        # Manage dependencies and parallel execution
        # Stream status updates via AG-UI events

    async def coordinate_agents(self, agents, tasks):
        """Coordinate multiple agents with real-time messaging."""
        # Agent discovery and pooling
        # Load balancing and resource allocation
        # Inter-agent message routing
```

**Workflow Examples**:
- **Account Analysis**: Memory Analyst → Data Scout → Recommendation Author
- **Risk Assessment**: Data Scout → Memory Analyst → Report Generation
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel agents with result aggregation

**Performance Improvements**:
- **Parallel Execution**: 2-5x faster for independent agent tasks
- **Resource Optimization**: 30-50% better resource utilization
- **Intelligent Routing**: Smart agent selection based on capabilities and load

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Chained Execution**: Sequential only, slower, no parallelism
2. **Peer-to-Peer Agents**: Complex implementation, harder to manage
3. **External Workflow Engine**: Heavy dependency, overkill for current needs

**Conclusion**: Centralized orchestrator provides optimal balance of control, performance, and maintainability for our multi-agent system.

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Real-time multi-agent coordination
- Improved performance through parallel execution
- Better resource utilization and load balancing
- Simplified client-side complexity
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

**Negative**:
- Increased backend complexity
- Single point of failure (mitigated with design patterns)
- More state to manage and synchronize

**Mitigation**:
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Extensive testing and validation

## ADR-005: Circuit Breaker and Graceful Degradation

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Decision Made**: Implement circuit breaker patterns with graceful degradation for enhanced system reliability and fault tolerance.

### Context
The enhanced system will have more components and dependencies, increasing potential failure points. Users need consistent experience even when some components fail or degrade performance.

### Decision
We will implement circuit breaker patterns throughout the system with graceful degradation strategies and automatic recovery mechanisms.

### Rationale
**Circuit Breaker Benefits**:
1. **Fault Containment**: Prevent cascading failures
2. **Fast Failure**: Quick fail responses instead of hanging
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing capabilities
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to simpler functionality
5. **User Experience**: Consistent experience during partial outages

**Circuit Breaker Architecture**:
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN

    async def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if self._should_attempt_reset():
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError()

        try:
            result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()
            raise
```

**Graceful Degradation Strategies**:
1. **Streaming Fallback**: Fall back to batch responses if streaming fails
2. **Agent Fallback**: Use simpler agents if complex ones fail
3. **Feature Tiers**: Core features always available, advanced features degrade
4. **Caching**: Serve cached responses during outages
5. **Offline Mode**: Basic functionality without backend connectivity

**Reliability Targets**:
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability with graceful degradation
- **Error Recovery**: 95% automatic error recovery success
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds even during partial degradation
- **Circuit Activation**: <5% of requests during normal operation

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Fail Fast Only**: No graceful degradation, poor UX during issues
2. **Retry Only**: Simple retries, no circuit breaking, can cause cascades
3. **Manual Intervention**: Require human intervention, slow recovery

**Conclusion**: Circuit breaker with graceful degradation provides optimal reliability and user experience during both normal operation and failure scenarios.

### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Enhanced system reliability and fault tolerance
- Better user experience during partial outages
- Automatic recovery and self-healing
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Reduced support overhead through automation

**Negative**:
- Increased implementation complexity
- Additional monitoring requirements
- More configuration and tuning needed
- Potential for overly conservative circuit behavior

**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive testing of failure scenarios
- Configurable thresholds and timeouts
- Detailed monitoring and alerting
- Regular circuit breaker performance reviews
