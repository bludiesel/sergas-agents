## Scoring Guide

- **90-100 points**: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT - Architecture is solid, proceed confidently
- **70-89 points**: ‚ö†Ô∏è GOOD - Minor issues, address before next phase
- **50-69 points**: üü° FAIR - Significant gaps, refactoring needed
- **<50 points**: üî¥ POOR - Major architectural issues, stop and reassess

## Escalation Process

### When to Escalate

**Immediate Escalation** (üî¥ Critical):
- Architecture violations detected
- Security vulnerabilities found
- Performance targets missed by >50%
- Critical component failure

**Urgent Escalation** (üü° High Priority):
- Design pattern deviations
- Test coverage drops below 80%
- Integration issues blocking progress
- Technical debt accumulating rapidly

**Standard Escalation** (üü¢ Normal Priority):
- Minor documentation gaps
- Code style inconsistencies
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Refactoring suggestions

### Escalation Chain

1. **Technical Lead** - First point of contact for architecture issues
2. **System Architect** - Major architecture decisions and ADR reviews
3. **Engineering Manager** - Resource allocation and timeline impacts
4. **CTO/VP Engineering** - Strategic architecture decisions
