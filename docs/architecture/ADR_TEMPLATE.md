# ADR-XXX: [Short Title of Decision]
## Architectural Decision Record

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
**Deciders**: [List of people involved in decision]
**Technical Story**: [GitHub issue, Jira ticket, or description]

---

## Context and Problem Statement

[Describe the context and problem statement that requires a decision. This should be a neutral statement of the problem, not advocating for any particular solution.]

**Example**:
> We need to choose how to stream agent execution events to the frontend in real-time. The frontend needs to display agent progress, tool calls, and approval requests as they happen. The current architecture has no event streaming mechanism, and we need to decide between WebSocket, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or polling approaches.

## Decision Drivers

[List the key factors that influenced the decision]

* **Driver 1**: [Description] (e.g., Performance requirements <200ms latency)
* **Driver 2**: [Description] (e.g., Browser compatibility across all major browsers)
* **Driver 3**: [Description] (e.g., Development complexity and time to implement)
* **Driver 4**: [Description] (e.g., Cost and licensing considerations)
* **Driver 5**: [Description] (e.g., Team expertise and maintainability)
* **Driver 6**: [Description] (e.g., Scalability to 10+ concurrent connections)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "[Option name]"

**Justification**:
[Explain why this option was chosen over the others. Reference the decision drivers and show how this option best satisfies them.]

**Example**:
> We chose Server-Sent Events (SSE) over WebSocket and polling for the following reasons:
>
> 1. **Performance**: Meets <200ms latency requirement with HTTP streaming
> 2. **Simplicity**: Unidirectional stream is simpler than full-duplex WebSocket for our use case
> 3. **Compatibility**: Better firewall/proxy compatibility than WebSocket
> 4. **Browser Support**: Native support via EventSource API in all major browsers
> 5. **Alignment**: Recommended by AG UI Protocol specification
> 6. **Development Time**: 2-3 days vs 5-7 days for WebSocket with fallbacks
> 7. **Cost**: No additional infrastructure required

**Expected positive consequences**:
- ✅ [Positive consequence 1]
- ✅ [Positive consequence 2]
- ✅ [Positive consequence 3]

**Example**:
> - ✅ Faster implementation (Week 6 timeline achievable)
> - ✅ Simpler codebase (less complexity to maintain)
> - ✅ Better reliability (fewer connection issues)

**Expected negative consequences (trade-offs)**:
- ⚠️ [Trade-off 1 and how we'll handle it]
- ⚠️ [Trade-off 2 and how we'll handle it]

**Example**:
> - ⚠️ Unidirectional only - but our use case only requires server→client streaming
> - ⚠️ HTTP/1.1 connection limit (6 per domain) - mitigated by HTTP/2 support
> - ⚠️ No native binary support - acceptable since we're using JSON events

**Confirmation criteria**:
[How will we confirm this decision was correct?]

**Example**:
> We will confirm this decision by:
> 1. Measuring event latency in production (<200ms target)
> 2. Testing with 10+ concurrent connections successfully
> 3. Validating browser compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
> 4. Collecting user feedback on real-time updates (target: <1% report issues)
> 5. Monitoring connection stability (target: >99% uptime)

## Implementation

**Timeline**: [When will this be implemented]

**Example**: Week 6, Days 1-2 (AG UI event infrastructure)

**Owner**: [Who is responsible for implementation]

**Files Affected**:
- `path/to/file1.py` - [What changes]
- `path/to/file2.py` - [What changes]
- `path/to/file3.tsx` - [What changes]

**Example**:
- `src/events/ag_ui_emitter.py` - AG UI event emitter implementation
- `src/api/routers/copilotkit_router.py` - SSE streaming endpoint
- `src/agents/base_agent.py` - Event emission integration

**Dependencies**:
- [Dependency 1: Library, service, or other component]
- [Dependency 2]
- [Dependency 3]

**Example**:
- `sse-starlette>=1.6.5` - FastAPI SSE support
- `ag-ui-protocol>=0.1.0` - AG UI event schemas
- BaseAgent implementation complete

**Testing Strategy**:
- [ ] Unit tests: [Description of unit test coverage]
- [ ] Integration tests: [Description of integration tests]
- [ ] E2E tests: [Description of end-to-end tests]
- [ ] Performance tests: [Benchmarks to validate decision]

**Example**:
- [ ] Unit tests: AGUIEventEmitter event formatting (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests: SSE streaming with multiple clients
- [ ] E2E tests: Complete workflow with frontend consuming events
- [ ] Performance tests: Latency benchmarks, concurrent connection tests

**Rollback Plan**:
[What's the plan if this decision doesn't work out?]

**Example**:
> If SSE proves inadequate, we can:
> 1. Switch to WebSocket (estimated 3-5 day effort)
> 2. Keep AG UI event format (no changes to agents)
> 3. Update only router and frontend EventSource→WebSocket

## Notes

[Any additional notes, context, or future considerations]

**Example**:
> **Future Considerations**:
> - HTTP/2 support should be enabled in production for better concurrent connection handling
> - Consider implementing event replay for clients that disconnect/reconnect
> - Monitor browser EventSource memory usage for long-running sessions
>
> **Alternative Approaches Considered but Not Evaluated**:
> - gRPC streaming - rejected early due to browser limitations
> - GraphQL subscriptions - rejected due to additional complexity
>
> **Team Feedback**:
> - Frontend team confirmed EventSource API familiarity
> - DevOps team confirmed proxy/load balancer SSE support
