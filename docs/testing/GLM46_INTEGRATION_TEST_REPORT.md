    ]
  }'
```

**GLM-4.6 Response Excerpt:**
```
### **Account Health & Risk Analysis: TEST-001**

Based on a review of account TEST-001, I have identified several critical
risks that require immediate attention to prevent churn, project failure,
and revenue loss.

The overall health of the account is **At Risk**. While we have a strong
executive sponsor, underlying issues with product adoption, user sentiment,
and project execution are creating significant friction.

---

### **Detailed Risk Breakdown**

#### **1. Product Adoption & Engagement Risk (HIGH)**

*   **Observation:** User logins are down 25% month-over-month. Our analytics
    show that only **15% of the purchased licenses are actively used weekly**.
    Key features, such as the 'Advanced Reporting' module, have an adoption
    rate of less than 5%.
*   **Risk:** The client is not realizing the full value of their investment.
    This makes the upcoming renewal in 4 months highly vulnerable.
*   **Potential Impact:** Direct revenue loss upon renewal, negative word-of-mouth.

#### **2. Project Delivery Risk (HIGH)**

*   **Observation:** The "Q4 Data Migration" project is currently **6 weeks
    behind schedule**. The internal project lead, Mark Johnson, has flagged
    a lack of clarity from the client's technical team as the primary blocker.
*   **Risk:** This delay erodes trust in our ability to deliver on commitments.
*   **Potential Impact:** Loss of trust, potential penalties, damage to our
    reputation, cancellation of the project.

#### **3. User Sentiment Risk (MEDIUM)**

*   **Observation:** Recent NPS survey results have dropped to **15**, down
    from 45 last quarter. Qualitative feedback mentions "the new user interface
    is confusing" and "report generation is too slow."
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Response Time:** 13.52s
**Model Confirmed:** glm-4.6
**Observations:**
- Comprehensive, professional risk analysis
- Structured with clear categories (HIGH/MEDIUM risk levels)
- Specific metrics and actionable insights
- Demonstrates strong understanding of account management domain
- Response quality exceeds expectations for this use case

---

### 4. Recommendation Generation Test

**Test Query:** "Generate recommendations for account XYZ-789"
**Account ID:** XYZ-789
**Operation:** generateCopilotResponse

**Curl Command:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/api/copilotkit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent": "orchestrator",
    "account_id": "XYZ-789",
    "workflow": "account_analysis",
    "operationName": "generateCopilotResponse",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Generate recommendations for account XYZ-789"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**GLM-4.6 Response Excerpt:**
```
### **Account Health Overview: XYZ-789**

**Overall Health Score: 78/100 (At Risk)**

The account is in a transitional phase. While there are significant strengths,
such as strong executive sponsorship and consistent logins, a recent decline
in key adoption metrics and a lack of user engagement with our premium features
indicate a risk of churn or downgrades.

---

### **Strategic Recommendations**

#### **Recommendation 1: Initiate a Strategic Value Review (SVR)**

**Objective:** To re-engage the executive sponsor (David Chen) by demonstrating
clear ROI and addressing their current business priorities.

**Action Plan:**
1.  **Prepare:** Compile a "Value Report" for David Chen. Include key metrics:
    time saved, projects completed using our tool, and a comparison of their
    usage vs. their goals set at onboarding.
2.  **Schedule:** Set up a 45-minute meeting titled "Strategic Q3 Review &
    Planning" with David Chen. Frame it as a partnership discussion, not a
    sales call.
3.  **Execute & Follow-up:** Present the value report, ask about their Q3/4
    objectives, and propose 1-2 ways our platform can help achieve them.

**Owner:** You, the Account Manager
**Timeline:** Within the next 2 weeks.

#### **Recommendation 2: Launch a Targeted Feature Re-engagement Campaign**

**Objective:** To increase the adoption of the underutilized advanced reporting
and collaboration features.

**Action Plan:**
1.  **Segment:** Identify the user group that previously used these features
    frequently but has since stopped.
2.  **Create Content:** Develop two short resources:
    *   A 3-minute "Use Case Spotlight" video showing how a team like theirs
        solved a common problem using the reporting feature.
    *   A "Pro-Tip" email template focused on a single collaboration shortcut.
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Response Time:** 9.29s
**Model Confirmed:** glm-4.6
**Observations:**
- Strategic, actionable recommendations with clear objectives
- Detailed action plans with specific steps
- Assigned owners and timelines
- Professional account management language
- Demonstrates deep understanding of customer success strategies

curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/api/copilotkit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operationName": "loadAgentState",
    "thread_id": "test_thread_001"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json

  }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS
**Response Time:** 0.003s
**Observations:**
- GraphQL response format correct for CopilotKit

---

## Frontend Analysis

### Current Status

**Frontend Server:** NOT RUNNING
**Expected URL:** http://localhost:3002
**Port Status:** Port 3002 not in use

### Frontend Configuration Review

**File:** `/frontend/app/page.tsx`
- ✅ CopilotKit components properly imported
- ✅ Runtime URL correctly configured: `http://localhost:8008`
- ✅ CopilotSidebar component configured with proper labels
- ✅ Account analysis components present

**File:** `/frontend/app/api/copilotkit/route.ts`
- ⚠️ Using OpenAI adapter instead of backend proxy
- ⚠️ Has local action handlers (should proxy to backend)
- ℹ️ This may cause issues - frontend should proxy to backend API

### Frontend Issues Identified

1. **Frontend API route is using OpenAIAdapter directly** instead of proxying to backend
2. **This creates two separate AI systems** instead of one integrated system
3. **Recommendation:** Update frontend to proxy all CopilotKit requests to backend

---

## Backend Implementation Analysis

### Architecture

**File:** `/src/api/routers/copilotkit_router.py`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ GraphQL-compatible response format
- ✅ Real GLM-4.6 integration via Z.ai
- ✅ Proper request routing (loadAgentState vs generateCopilotResponse)
- ✅ Error handling with fallback messages
- ✅ Structured logging with structlog

**GLM-4.6 Integration:**
```python
# Uses Anthropic client format with Z.ai base URL
client = Anthropic(api_key=api_key, base_url=base_url)
response = client.messages.create(
    model="glm-4.6",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system=system_prompt,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}]
)
```

**Environment Configuration:**
- API Key: From `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var
- Base URL: From `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env var
- Model: From `CLAUDE_MODEL` env var (set to "glm-4.6")

---

## Configuration Validation

### Environment Variables

**Required for GLM-4.6:**
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=6845ef1767204ea98a67faaecb3afe08.fyZ4DweXVe3SvCXS
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic
CLAUDE_MODEL=glm-4.6
```

**Status:**
- ⚠️ Variables are in `.env.real` but may not be active in `.env`
- Backend is running successfully, so credentials must be loaded somehow
- Need to verify environment variable source

### Backend Process

**Process Details:**
```
PID: 55765
Command: uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8008 --reload
Status: Running
```

   - **Priority:** MEDIUM

### Minor Issues

3. **Environment Variable Management**
   - **Issue:** Unclear which .env file is active
   - **Impact:** Potential configuration drift
   - **Resolution:** Consolidate to single .env file
   - **Priority:** LOW

4. **Response Time Optimization**
   - **Issue:** 6-13s response times may feel slow to users
   - **Impact:** User experience
   - **Resolution:** Consider implementing streaming responses
   - **Priority:** LOW

3. **Test E2E Integration**
   - Open http://localhost:3002
   - Test CopilotKit sidebar with queries
   - Verify responses come from backend GLM-4.6

### Future Enhancements

4. **Implement Streaming Responses**
   - Add SSE support to backend
   - Update frontend to handle streaming
   - Improve perceived response time

5. **Add Response Caching**
   - Cache common queries
   - Reduce redundant API calls
   - Improve response times

6. **Enhanced Error Handling**
