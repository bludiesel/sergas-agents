## Priority 2: Technical Spikes (Week 1-2)

### 2.1 Zoho MCP Endpoint Evaluation
**Owner**: Backend Engineer
**Deadline**: Week 1
**Effort**: 16-24 hours

**Objectives**:
1. Connect to provisioned Zoho MCP endpoint
2. Enumerate and document available tools
3. Test authentication and token refresh
4. Validate coverage of required operations
5. Identify gaps requiring supplemental REST/SDK

**Deliverables**:
- Tool catalog with schemas and examples
- Coverage gap analysis report
- Authentication flow documentation
- Recommendation: use official MCP vs. custom server

**Success Criteria**:
- Successfully authenticate and execute read operations
- Clear understanding of what's covered vs. gaps
- Decision on primary integration approach

**Risks**:
- MCP endpoint access delayed → Use community server for spike
- Insufficient coverage → Plan for extensive custom REST work

### 2.2 Cognee Pilot Deployment
**Owner**: AI/ML Engineer
**Deadline**: Week 2
**Effort**: 20-30 hours

**Objectives**:
1. Deploy Cognee (Docker or cloud instance)
2. Ingest sample dataset (50-100 accounts)
3. Test query performance and retrieval quality
4. Evaluate scalability to 5k accounts
5. Prototype custom MCP server for Cognee

**Deliverables**:
- Operational Cognee instance with test data
- Query performance benchmarks
- Retrieval quality assessment
- MCP server prototype (basic tools)
- Recommendation: Cognee vs. alternative

**Success Criteria**:
- Query response time <2 seconds
- Relevant results returned for test queries
- Confidence in scalability to production volume

**Risks**:
- Deployment complexity → Use managed service alternative
- Poor retrieval quality → Evaluate vector DB fallback
- Performance issues → Test alternative memory solutions

### 2.3 Claude Agent SDK Proof of Concept
**Owner**: AI/ML Engineer
**Deadline**: Week 2
**Effort**: 16-24 hours

**Objectives**:
1. Set up Python 3.14 environment with Claude SDK
2. Implement basic orchestrator with single subagent
3. Test MCP integration (mock Zoho tools)
4. Validate hooks and audit logging
5. Measure token usage and latency

**Deliverables**:
- Working PoC: Orchestrator → Subagent → Result
- Token usage and cost estimates
- Latency measurements
- Hooks implementation example
- Lessons learned document

**Success Criteria**:
- End-to-end agent workflow completes successfully
- Hooks capture audit trail
- Performance within acceptable range
- Team confident in SDK capabilities

**Risks**:
- SDK complexity → Engage Anthropic support early
- Unexpected limitations → Adjust architecture
- Cost concerns → Optimize prompts and caching
