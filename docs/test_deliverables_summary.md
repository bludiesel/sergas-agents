# Test Strategy Deliverables Summary

## Created Files

### 1. Testing Strategy Documentation
**Location**: `/docs/testing_strategy.md`

Comprehensive testing strategy covering:
- Test pyramid structure (70% unit, 25% integration, 5% e2e)
- Framework stack (pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov)
- Unit testing approach for orchestrator and subagents
- Integration testing patterns for workflows
- End-to-end testing scenarios
- Test data management strategy
- Coverage requirements (>80% for critical paths)
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Performance testing approach
- Security testing requirements
- Best practices and debugging guidelines

### 2. Pytest Configuration
**Location**: `/tests/conftest.py`

Global test fixtures including:
- Mock Zoho CRM client with realistic API simulation
- Mock Cognee memory client with storage operations
- Mock MCP server for tool invocation testing
- Sample test data fixtures (accounts, contacts, deals, activities)
- Test data generators for various account types
- Assertion helpers for validation
- Performance and time mocking utilities

### 3. Unit Test Skeleton
**Location**: `/tests/unit/test_orchestrator_skeleton.py`

Test structure covering:
- Orchestrator initialization and configuration
- Request routing to appropriate subagents
- Subagent coordination and context passing
- Memory integration (store/retrieve context)
- Error handling (API errors, invalid inputs, memory failures)
- Response formatting and metadata
- Performance characteristics
- Integration point validation

**Test count**: 30+ test cases defined

### 4. Integration Test Skeleton
**Location**: `/tests/integration/test_workflow_skeleton.py`

Test structure covering:
- Complete data retrieval workflows
- Account health analysis workflows
- Recommendation generation workflows
- Multi-step workflow orchestration
- Memory-driven context awareness
- Error recovery and graceful degradation
- Performance under load
- MCP tool integration

**Test count**: 25+ integration scenarios defined

## Test Organization

```

├── conftest.py                    # Global fixtures and configuration
├── unit/                          # Unit tests (fast, isolated)
│   └── test_orchestrator_skeleton.py
├── integration/                   # Integration tests
│   └── test_workflow_skeleton.py
└── fixtures/                      # Test data (to be added)
```

## Key Features

### Mock Implementations
1. **MockZohoClient**: Full-featured Zoho API simulation
   - Account, contact, deal, activity operations
   - Rate limiting simulation
   - Token refresh mechanism

2. **MockCogneeMemory**: Memory operations simulation
   - Store/retrieve operations
   - Dataset management
   - Search functionality

3. **MockMCPServer**: MCP tool invocation tracking
   - Tool registration
   - Call history tracking
   - Response mocking

### Test Data Generators
- `AccountDataGenerator`: Creates healthy, at-risk, and churned accounts
- Sample data fixtures for common CRM entities
- Time mocking for deterministic tests

### Coverage Requirements
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage (scoring, risk detection, recommendations)
- **Standard paths**: >80% coverage (data retrieval, orchestration)
- **CI/CD enforcement**: Fail builds below 80% coverage

## Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov pytest-mock
   ```

2. **Run tests** (will fail initially - TDD):
   ```bash
   pytest tests/unit -v
   pytest tests/integration -v
   ```

3. **Implement code to pass tests**:
   - Start with orchestrator initialization
   - Add request routing logic
   - Implement subagent coordination
   - Add memory integration

4. **Verify coverage**:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
   ```

## TDD Workflow

1. ✅ **Write tests first** (COMPLETED)
2. ⏳ **Run tests** (should fail - no implementation yet)
3. ⏳ **Implement minimum code** to pass tests
4. ⏳ **Refactor** while keeping tests green
5. ⏳ **Repeat** for each feature

## Test Markers

Use pytest markers to run specific test types:

```bash
# Unit tests only
pytest -m unit

# Integration tests only
pytest -m integration

# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Performance tests
pytest -m performance
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Comprehensive test strategy documented
- ✅ Pytest configuration with reusable fixtures
- ✅ Unit test skeleton with 30+ test cases
- ✅ Integration test skeleton with 25+ scenarios
- ✅ Mock implementations for all external dependencies
- ✅ Test data generators and fixtures
- ✅ Coverage requirements defined (>80%)
- ✅ CI/CD integration guidelines provided

## Time Estimate

- Test strategy development: 30 minutes ✅
- Implementation to pass all tests: 8-10 hours (estimated)
- Achieving 80% coverage: 12-15 hours (estimated)
