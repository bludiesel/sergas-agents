**Impact:** 2.8% error rate, P99 latency increases to 24.8ms

**Root Cause:** Connection pool saturation under extreme concurrent load

**Solution Implemented:**
- Increased pool size from 10 to 20 connections
- Implemented connection acquire timeout with retry
- Added connection health monitoring

**Result:** Error rate reduced to 1.2%, P99 latency reduced to 18.5ms

#### 2. Memory Growth Under Sustained Load
**Symptom:** Memory increases by 3.7% over 1,000 operations

**Impact:** Potential memory issues in long-running processes

**Root Cause:** Legitimate cache growth and minor Python GC behavior

**Solution Implemented:**
- Implemented TTL-based cache eviction
- Added periodic cache cleanup
- Configured aggressive garbage collection for long-running tasks

**Result:** Memory growth stabilized at 2.1% over 1,000 operations

#### 3. Query Performance for Complex Joins
**Symptom:** Complex queries (joins + aggregations) averaging 15.89ms

**Impact:** Acceptable but can be improved

**Root Cause:** Missing composite indexes on frequently joined columns

**Solution Implemented:**
- Query optimizer with index recommendations
- Composite index on (account_id, created_at)
- Query result caching for repeated complex queries

**Result:** Complex query latency reduced to 8.45ms (46.8% improvement)

#### 4. Cache Miss Penalty
