## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment Process

1. **Deploy to Green Environment**
   - New version deployed to inactive environment
   - Database migrations executed
   - Health checks validated

2. **Gradual Traffic Migration**
   - 10% traffic → Monitor for 5 minutes
   - 50% traffic → Monitor for 10 minutes
   - 100% traffic → Monitor for 15 minutes

3. **Validation**
   - Automated smoke tests
   - Integration test suite
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Error rate monitoring

4. **Completion**
   - Decommission old environment
   - Tag new environment as stable
   - Cleanup resources

### Rollback Capability

- **Automatic Rollback:** Triggered on health check failures
- **Manual Rollback:** One-command emergency rollback
- **Database Rollback:** Restore from automated snapshots
- **RTO:** < 5 minutes for traffic switch, < 30 minutes for full rollback
