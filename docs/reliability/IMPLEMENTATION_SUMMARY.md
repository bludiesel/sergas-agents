## Integration with Existing Systems

### Circuit Breakers

The new reliability system integrates seamlessly with existing circuit breakers:

```python
from src.resilience.circuit_breaker_manager import CircuitBreakerManager
from src.reliability.graceful_degradation import DegradationManager

cb_manager = CircuitBreakerManager()
degradation = DegradationManager(circuit_breaker_manager=cb_manager)
```

### Health Monitoring

Works alongside existing health monitor:

```python
from src.resilience.health_monitor import HealthMonitor
from src.reliability.health_checks import HealthCheckRegistry

# Both systems can coexist
existing_monitor = HealthMonitor(...)
new_registry = HealthCheckRegistry()
```

## Monitoring and Alerting Setup

### Recommended Alerts

**Health Checks:**
- Alert when overall status is "unhealthy"
- Alert when degraded for > 15 minutes
- Alert on check timeout increases

**Backups:**
- Alert on backup failure
- Alert on missing backups (> 24 hours)
- Alert on low disk space for backups

**Rate Limiting:**
- Alert when utilization > 90%
- Alert on high rejection rates
- Alert when backpressure activated

**Queue Management:**
- Alert when queue depth > 80%
- Alert on worker failures
- Alert on timeout increases

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Database Backup Strategy**
   - Currently supports PostgreSQL only
   - MySQL/MongoDB support would require additional strategies
   - WAL archiving for PITR not fully implemented

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - In-memory only (not distributed)
   - For distributed rate limiting, consider Redis-based implementation
   - Token bucket refill happens on-demand, not background

3. **Health Checks**
   - No automatic remediation
   - Requires manual intervention based on alerts

4. **Feature Flags**
   - JSON file persistence only
   - No admin UI for flag management
   - Consider integrating with feature flag service for production

---

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
1. Distributed rate limiting using Redis
2. WAL-based PITR for PostgreSQL
3. Backup encryption at rest
4. Additional database backup strategies (MySQL, MongoDB)
5. Admin UI for feature flag management

### Medium Priority
1. Automatic remediation for common issues
2. Machine learning-based anomaly detection
3. Multi-region backup replication
4. Advanced capacity planning algorithms
5. Integration with external monitoring (Datadog, New Relic)

### Low Priority
1. Backup compression optimization
2. Custom backup retention policies
3. Backup bandwidth throttling
4. Advanced circuit breaker analytics
5. Chaos engineering integration
