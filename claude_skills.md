Comprehensive Claude Skills Implementation Documentation

  Based on my research from official Anthropic documentation, GitHub repositories, and the broader skills ecosystem,
  here's a complete guide to implementing skills in the Claude Agent SDK.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The Claude Skills System represents a sophisticated modular approach to extending AI capabilities through structured
  knowledge packages. It's designed around progressive disclosure and context-efficient loading, making it
  fundamentally different from simple plugin systems.

  ---

  # My Skill

  ## Purpose
  [Brief description of skill purpose]

  ## When to Use
  [Specific triggers and use cases]

  ## Implementation
  [Step-by-step instructions]
  EOF

  Step 3: Skill Testing

  # Test skill invocation
  echo "Use the my-skill to [task]" | claude

  # Validate skill discovery
  claude "List available skills for [category]"

  Step 4: Skill Distribution (Optional)

  # Package for plugin distribution
  mkdir my-plugin
  cp -r ~/.claude/skills/my-skill my-plugin/skills/

  # Create plugin manifest
  cat > my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json << 'EOF'
  {
    "name": "my-plugin",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Plugin with my custom skill"
  }
  EOF

  🎯 Best Practices (Official Guidelines)

  Skill Design Principles

  1. Single Responsibility: Each skill should focus on one capability
  2. Clear Triggers: Describe specific situations when the skill should be used
  3. Progressive Disclosure: Start with essential info, provide details on demand
  4. Context Efficiency: Include only necessary information to minimize token usage

  Security Considerations

  ---
  allowed-tools: Read, Grep  # Restrict dangerous tools
  metadata:
    security_level: "restricted"
    audit_required: true
  ---

  Documentation Standards

  - Include version information in metadata
  - Provide concrete examples
  - Document dependencies and prerequisites
  - Test with real scenarios before distribution

  Team Collaboration

  - Use project skills for shared workflows
  - Document skill versions and changes
  - Establish skill governance guidelines
  - Regular skill review and updates

  🔍 Skill Discovery & Usage

  Automatic Skill Loading

  Claude automatically loads skills based on:
  - Task Context: Files in workspace trigger relevant skills
  - User Mentions: Direct references to skill capabilities
  - Pattern Matching: Keywords and intent analysis
  - File Types: Specific file extensions trigger specialized skills

  Skill Invocation Examples

  User: "Can you help me extract tables from this PDF?"
  → Claude loads pdf-processing skill automatically

  User: "Use the testing skill to verify the web application"
  → Claude loads web-app-tester skill by name

  User: "Create a weather MCP server for our dashboard"
  → Claude loads weather-server-skill for implementation

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The skills system represents a paradigm shift from traditional plugin architectures by using context-aware,
  model-invoked capabilities. This allows for more intelligent and appropriate skill selection based on the actual task
   at hand, rather than manual plugin activation.
